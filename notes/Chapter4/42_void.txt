4.2 Void


Void is the easiest of the data type, it basically means no type

Void is out first example of an incomplete type, and incomplete type is something that has been declared and not yet defined.


The compiler knows about the existence of the type but doesnt know how much memory to allocate for it. void is intentionanly incomplete since it represents the lack of a type

Functions that do not return a value:

we use void as a return value for a function that doesnt return anything

In C void is an easy way to say a function does not take any parameters

The keyword void is considerted deprecated in C++.


The void keyword has void pointers.
