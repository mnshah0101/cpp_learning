4.7 Introduction to Scientific Notation

Scientific notation is useful shorthand for writing lengthy numbres in a concise manner,

Numbers in scentific notation take the form signficant * 10^names

We can make really large or small numbers smaller in scentific notation (when it has a lot of zeros)

We can use the letter e to represent times 10 to the power of

Sig Digits:
The digits in the significad are the signficant digits

The more digist in the significant the more precise a number is

3.14 is 3.14e0 

how the convert decimals numbers to scientific notation
Use the following procedure

You want to make it so only 1 digit to the left of the period


Trailing 0s after a decmical are considered 0, but for decimals with no trailing zeros, they are insignificant

so 87.0 the 0 is signifcant to signify the precision

Once stored in memory there is no way to tell the difference but its good to have it as literals
