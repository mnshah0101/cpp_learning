The smalest unit of memory is a binary digit, also called bit.

The smallest unit of memory that can be addressed is a byte.

The modern standard is that a byte equals 8 bits.

A data type tells the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way.

Void is used to indicate no type it is an incomplete type where the compiler doesn't know how much memory to allocate.

the sizeof operator can be used to return the size of a type in bytes - its usually the size of the architecture - on 32 bit its 32 bits


Signed - postive and negative
Unsigned - positive
Fixed Width - gauranteed sixes

size_t - unsigned integral that is the size or length of objects
Scientific Notation - short hand way of writing lengthy numbers
Floating point - set of types designed to holdreal numbers, precision is how mnay sig figs, rounding error is when too many sig figs are stored,

boolean - used to store true or false

if statements - allow us to write certain code under certain conditions

else statement can be used to executre a statement when a prioer if statement condition evals to false

Char is used to store values that are interpreted as an ACII character. When using chars be careful not to mix up ASCII values and numbers

Angled brackers are used in C++ to represent something that needs a paramterizable type. This is used in static_cast
