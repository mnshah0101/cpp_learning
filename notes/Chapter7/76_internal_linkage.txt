7.6 Internal linkage

Global vs and function identigiers can either have internal linkage or exteneral linkage.

an indeitifer with internal linkage can be seen within a single translation unit but are not accessible from other translation units.

Global Variables with internal variables are called internval variables

to make a non-constant global var internal we use the static keyword

Const and constexpr have internal linkage by default

the static kewyord is a storage class specifier, which sets the name's linkage and its storage duration:
static, extern mutable are the most common

const has internal linkage so that they are only propogated through header files 

static vs unnamed spaces:
unnamed namespaces can give internal linkage to a wider range of idenitifers
