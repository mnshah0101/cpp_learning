7.4 Global variables

in C++ vars can be defined outside functions, called global vars

global vars are declared at the top of a file by oncetion.


identifiers in the global namepsace have global namespace scope, which means they are visible from the point of definition until the end of the file in whcih they are declared.

Once declared, a global var can be used anywhere in the file from that point onward.

Global vars can also be defined in a user defined namespace.
since the namespace has global scope, so does the variables.


global vars have static duration:
it is created when the program starts (before main executes) and is destroyed when it ends



by convention, developers predix global var identifiers with "g" or "g_"

"g_" is hungarian notation


Unlike local vars which are unitiialized by defailt, variabes with static duration are zero-intialized by defailt.

constexpr must be iniitalized (not zero iniitalized)
const global vars can be init with a value
