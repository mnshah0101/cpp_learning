7,7 External linkage and variable forward declarations

An identifier with external linkage can be seen and used from the file its defined and other files

these identifiers are truly global

functions have external linkage by default
you need to use forward declarations to be able to use them

global vars with external linkage:

global vars with exeternal linkage are called external vars, we can use the extern keyword for this

to actually use a external global var that has been defined in another file, you must place a forward declaration, which is also done by the extern keyword

if you want to define an uninitlaized non constant global var, do not use the extern keyword, otherwise C++ thinks you are making a forward declaration.

avoid using extern on a non const glob variable with an initializer

onlu use extern for global var forward declarations or const global var definitions, since they are implicity extern
