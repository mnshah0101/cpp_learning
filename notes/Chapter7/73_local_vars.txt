7.3 Local variables

There is no single atttirbute that defines a variable as local, they have several properites that differentiate them from non-local variables

Local vars have block scope:
they are in scope from their point of definition until the end of the block they are defined within

Local variables have automatic storage duration:
for automatic storage duration, they are created at the point of the definition and dstroyed at the nd of the block they are defined in

local vars are sometimes called automatic vars

 Local vars have no linkage:

 linkage deterines whether a declaration of that same identifier refers to the same object or function
 Local vars have no linkaege


 Vars should be defined in the most limited scope:
 if a var is only used in a nested block, it should be defined in that block.
