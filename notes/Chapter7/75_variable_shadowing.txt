7.5 Variable Shadowing

Each block defines its own scope reigion. when nested vars hide outer variabes in areas when they are both in scope this is called Shadowing

Avoid variable shadowing:

Shadowing can lead to inadvertent errors where the wrong variable is used or modified.

It is also trivially avoidable if we use the g_ prefix
