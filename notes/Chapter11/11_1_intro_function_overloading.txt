Intro to function Overloading


Function overloading allows us to create multiple functions with the sanme name so as long as they have different paraeter types

Compiler tries to match the function to the approopriate function call.
This is called overload resolution

Making it compiler- Each overloaded function has to be differentiated
- Each call to an overloaded function has to resolve to an overloaded function.


If it cannot be resolved than it creates a compile error.


This gives a great way to reduce compplexity by reducing the number of function name you need to remember.
