1.7 Naming Identifiers

Identifier naming rules:

as a reminder, the name of variable (or a function, type, or other kind of item) is called an identifier, c++ gives a lot of flexibility to name identifiers as you wish.

- Identifiers can not be a keyword, keywords are reserved
- Can only be xomposed of letters, numbers and underscore character
- Must begin with a letter or underscore
- c++ is case sensitive


Bes practice is Camel Case or snake Case


Name your identifiers something that should make clear what value they are hokding. 

Giving a trivial identifier an over complex name impedes understanding of the program. A good rule of thumb is to make the length of an identifier propertional to how specific and accesible the identifier is.

An identifier that exists for only a few statements (e.g. in the body of a short function) can have a shorter name.
An identifier that is accessible from anywhere might benefit from a longer name.
An identifier that represents a non-specific number (e.g. anything the user provides) can have a shorter name.
An identifier that represents a specific value (e.g. the length of an inseam in millimeters) should have a longer name.
