1.11 Developing your first program

Lets create a program that takes an input and prints its double

#include <iostream>

// worst version
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ };
	std::cin >> num;

	num = num * 2; // double num's value, then assign that value back to num

	std::cout << "Double that number is: " << num << '\n';

	return 0;
}

#include <iostream>

// preferred version
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";

	int num{ };
	std::cin >> num;

	std::cout << "Double that number is: " <<  num * 2 << '\n'; // use an expression to multiply num * 2 at the point where we are going to print it

	return 0;
}


The first and primary goal of programming is to make your program work. A program that doesn't work isn't useful regardless of hiw well its written.

You have to write a program once to know how you should have written it the first time.

Solutions are obvious the first time.
