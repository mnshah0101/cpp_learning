5.8 Intro to std::string_view

Init and copying a std::string is slow

std::string_view:
 
provides read only access to an exisiting string without making a copy
this is great for function parameters


std::string_view can be init with many types of strings, with a C style, std::string, or a another std::string_view

the std::string_view also accepts many types of string as a string arguement, it will just get casted

std::string_view will not implicitly convert to std::string



If we desire this we can explicitly create or use static ast

Assinging a new string to a std::string_view causes it to view a new string, it doesn't change the string


sv creates a string view by default

std::string_view has full support for constexpr

conexpr str std::string_view is the preferred choice when symbolic constants are needed
