Numeral Systems  (decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal)

In everyday we use the decimal system, so this is the one built in
In binary there are only 2 digits: 0 and 1 so it is called base 2:
in order of popularity we have decimal, binary, hexadecimal, octal

in ocotal avaiable digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7
Numbers are outputted in decimal by default

for binary we use the 0b, hexademical we use 0x, we can use ' as decimal seperators.
to output in the different numerical systems you can do std::cout << std::oct <<


can use std::bitset <8>  as a type to store a bit literal

and then we can print it

you can also use the std::format("{:b}\n", 0b00101)

32 > 20 in hexademical and 100000 in binary
