6.1 Operator Precedence and Associativity

Chapter Introduction 

Eval of compoind experssions



Comoiler must do two things:
the compiler must parse the expression and determine how operands are grouped with operators.

This is done via precendence and associativit rulkes,

At compile time or run time the operands are evaluated are they produce a result.


Use parenthesis to make operations easier to undestand.

Value computation means the execution of operators in an expression to produce a value.

Evaluation of operands - term in C++

Clang evaluaties left to right - GCC goes right to left
