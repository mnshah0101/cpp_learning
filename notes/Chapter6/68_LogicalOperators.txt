Logical Operators

While relationla operators can be used to test whether a paticular condition is true
or false, they can only test on condition at a time, often, we need ti nkow whether all the multiple numbers.


Logical NOT - !
Logical AND - &&
Logical OR - ||

NOT has a very high level of precedence

Logical OR is used to test whether of two conditions is true.
If left operand evaluates to true wherher either of the two conditions is true.

Logical and is used to test whether both are true

Short circuit evaluation
short circuit means if x==1 && ++y == 2 
if x not 1 then the second doesnt evlauation

XOR > C++ doesnt have a logical bitwise XOR


opeeraot != produces the same as logical XOR given bool operands
