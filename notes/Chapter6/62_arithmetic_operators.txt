unary minus +x, -x (value of x and negation)

Binary arithmetic operators:

addition > +
subtraction > -
multiplixation > *

division operator has two modes - integral and floating point


using static_cast<> to do floating point division w integers

static_cast<double>(x)

Dividing by 0 causes undefined behavior

The result of float division is NaN or Inf

Arithmetic Assingment operators:
+=
-=
*=...


Modifying and non-modifying oeprators:
