0.7 — Compiling your first program


Projects:
To write a C++ project inside an IDE, we will create a new project. A project holds all your source code, images, data files, etc. The project also saves IDE and compiler settings. Each project corresponds to a program.

What is the difference between the compile, build, rebuild, clean, and run/start options in my IDE?



Build compiles all modified code files in the project or workspace/solution, and then links the object files into an executable. If no code files have been modified since the last build, this option does nothing.
Clean removes all cached objects and executables so the next time the project is built, all files will be recompiled and a new executable produced.
Rebuild does a “clean”, followed by a “build”.
Compile recompiles a single code file (regardless of whether it has been cached previously). This option does not invoke the linker or produce an executable.
Run/start executes the executable from a prior build. Some IDEs (e.g. Visual Studio) will invoke a “build” before doing a “run” to ensure you are running the latest version of your code. Otherwise (e.g. Code::Blocks) will just execute the prior executable.
