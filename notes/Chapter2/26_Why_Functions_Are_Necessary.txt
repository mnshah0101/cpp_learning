2.6 Why Are Functions Necessary and When To Use Them


Functions provide:
Organization - can organize code better, almost write mini progams
Reusability - can use the same function instead of writing the function again and again
Testing - since there is less code, there is less code to text
Extensibility - when we want to extend our program, we only have to change it once
Abstraction - we can write the function once and believe it works


Effectively Using Functions:

- Groups of code that appear a lot of times should be af unction
- Code that has a good set of inputs and outputs should be a function
- Should perform one task
- When a function becomes too long it should be broken up into many functions (called refactoring)
