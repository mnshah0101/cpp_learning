2.3 Void Functions

To tell the compiler the function doesn't return a value, we use the void keyword.
We can use this for functions that are standalone and don't affect other parts of the program.
Void functions don't need a return statement

Void functions also can't be used anywhere that requires an expression since it doesn't return anything. This will cause a compiler error, for example using a void function call in a std::cout
Returning a value from a void function causes a compiler error.
