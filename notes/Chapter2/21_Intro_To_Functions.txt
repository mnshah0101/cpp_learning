Introduction to Functions

A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a paticular job.

Every executable program has a function named main().

Standard library comes with many functions but the functions you write yourself are called user-defined functions.


Functional call - tells the CPU to interrupt currenct function and execute anohter function.


A function being called is the calle and the function calling i the caller. Invocation and invoking is also used.


An example of a user-defined function:
returnType functionName(){
    //this is the function body
}

The first line is thes function header and it tells the compuler about the function the functions name and some other information that we'' cover in future lessons.


Curly braces contain the function body
Functions can be called multiple times.

Functions an call functions that call other functions


Nested functions are not supported in C++.

Foo is a meaningless word that is used as aplacefholder name for a function or variable when the name is unimportantt ot he demonstration of some concept.
