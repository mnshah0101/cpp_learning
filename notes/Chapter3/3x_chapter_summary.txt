Chapter 3 Summary


A syntax error is when you write a statement that is not valid in C++.
A semantic error occurs when a statement is syntiacicaly valid, but does not do what the programmer intended.

The process of finding and removing errors from a program is caled debugging.


5 steps to debugging:
1. Find the root cause.
2. Understand the problem.
3. etermine a fix.
4. Repair the issue.
5. Retest.


A static analysis tool looks at your code to look for semantic issues.

There are a number of tactics we can use to find issues:
comment out code
output statements to valid code flow
printNames

Log file records events that occur in a program, writing info is logging

Restructuring code wtihout changing how it behaves is called Refactoring

Unit teting is testing small untis of source code

Defensive programming to write programs that dont break

A debugger is a tool that allows the programer to control how a program executes 

Stepping is set of function to go through code
Step into: stepping line by line 
Step over: like step into but steps over functions
Run to cursor: goes to the cursor
Step Out: executves all remaining code in the function
Run to coursor: executes to the cursor
Continue: finishes all the way
Breakpoint: runs to breakpoint
Set next: when runs goes to set next
Watching a variable allows you to inspect value while in debug.

The call stack is the list of all active functions we're in.
