Syntax and Semantic Error


Although debugging tools aren't part of C++, learning to find bugs is super important in programming.

We will spend some time covering this topic.


Synatx Errors:
Programming can be challenging and C++ is quirky. There are a lot of ways to make mistakes.

Errors fall into two categories.  Synatx aerors and semnatic errors (logical)

A syntax error occuers whne you write a statement that is not valid according to the grammer of the C++ langauge.


The compiler detects synatx errors and issues a compilation warning so these are easily identifiable.

A semantic error is one in meaning, these occur when a statemtn us syntactically valid, but violates other rules of the langauge or does not do what the programmer intended.

for example:


Some can be caught with by the compiler
int main()
{
    5 = x; // x not declared, cannot assign a value to 5
    return "hello"; // "hello" cannot be converted to an int
}


Others are at runtimeL

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int a { 10 };
    int b { 0 };
    std::cout << a << " / " << b << " = " << a / b << '\n'; // division by 0 is undefined in mathematics
    return 0;
}

cannot divide by 0


In most non trivial programs, semantic errors are harder to spot.
