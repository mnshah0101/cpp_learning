3.2 The debugging processs


All bugs come from a simple premise:


Something you though was correct wasnt. Figuing out where the error is is challenging. Let's outline the dbeugging process.

A genearl approach:

1)Find the root cause of the problem (line of code not working)
2) Ensure you understand why the issue is occuring.
3) Determine how you'll fix the issue
4) Repair the issue causing the problem
5) Retest to ensure no new problems have emerged


#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y) // this function is supposed to perform addition
{
    return x - y; // but it doesn't due to the wrong operator being used
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << "5 + 3 = " << add(5, 3) << '\n'; // should produce 8, but produces 2

    return 0;
}

Lets try with this ine of code:

1) Find the root cause: on line 10 we are passing in literals for arguements, so no error there, but when we are returning we have the wrong symbol.

2) Understand the problem, we are using the wrong operator.

3) Determine a fix: We canchange the opeartor form minus to add.

4) Repair the issue: Actually change the operator.


5) Try the simple program, and test it!
