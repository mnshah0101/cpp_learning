3.8 Watching Variables

Watching variables tells us the values of our variables while the program is executing in debug mode. Most debuggers provide several ways to do this.

You can hover your mouse of the variable and it will tell you the value.

The watch window:


The watch window is a window where you can add variables youdl like to continuosly inspect, these variables will be updates as you step through the program.


Setting a breakpoint on watched variables

Some debugger will allow you to set a breakpoint on watched variables rather than a line.
This will stop execution whenever the value of that variable changes.

The watch window can evaluate expressions too
The watch window will also allow you to evaluate simple expressions. If you havenâ€™t already, run to cursor to line 12. Then try entering x + 2 into the watch window and see what happens (it should evaluate to 8).



Many debuggers will offer some way to watch the value of all vairables local to a scope.
