13.12 â€” Member selection with pointers and references

you can use member selection operator to selecet a member from a struct object

Member selection cant be used directly with a pointer to a a struct

since we have to dereference we can do
(*ptr).field
this is a bit ugly, so we can use -> (arrow operator)

Chaining -> operator:

it can be chained if the member is a pointer to a class type

Mixing points and non pointers to members

the member selection oeprator is always applied to the currently selected valirable, if you have a mix of pointers and normal, you can see member selections where . and -> are both used in sequence
