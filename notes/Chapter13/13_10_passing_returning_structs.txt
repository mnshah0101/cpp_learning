13.10 â€” Passing and returning structs



Passing structs by reference:

We can pass the entire struct to a function by reference to avoid making copies

Passing temporary structs:


we can do 
 printEmployee(Employee { 14, 32, 24.15 });

  printEmployee({ 15, 28, 18.27 });

  this gets casted into an Employee

  temporary objects are created and destroyed at thee nd fo the full expression


  when a temporary object used as function arguement, it will only allow places where pass by value and const reference exists


  Returning structs

Point3d getZeroPoint()
{
    return Point3d { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 }; // return an unnamed Point3d
}
we cant return reference


in case where the function has a returm type we can omit the type in ther eturn statement, except we usually should

Structs are an important building block

structs are useful in of them selves, classes build on structs
