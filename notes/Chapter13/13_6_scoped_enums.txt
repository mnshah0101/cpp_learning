13.6 — Scoped enumerations (enum classes)


unscoped enums are not type safe for example, if you compare from two diff enumearators they compar ebased on integer value

Scoped enum:

scoped enums work similar to unscopeed, except they dont convert toingeters and only placed into scope region of the enumerations

we use enum class and we reference by :: scope resolution operator


class is overloaded and means diff things based on context


Scoped enums define their own scope regions

scoped enums act like a namepscae for their enumearators


Scoped enumerations don’t implicitly convert to integers: but you can compare since they are part of the same scoped enum

can cast with static_Cast, or std:to_underlying




Easing the conversion of scoped enumerators to integers (advanced) 

- useful hack is to overload oaptor + to perform things,so you can put it in from to turn into the scope


using enum:
imports all of the enumerators from an enum unto the scope, which basically makes the scoped enum into an unscoped
