13.7 â€” Introduction to structs, members, and member selection

A struct is a program defined datat type that allows us to bundle multiple values together


A struct is a class type (as are classes and unions). As such, anything that applies to class types applies to structs.


struct Employee
{
    int id {};
    int age{};
    double wage{};
}

A struct is a class type (as are classes and unions). As such, anything that applies to class types applies to structs.

members are called data memberes

empty braces ensures they are value initalizated

to use a type we define a variable type Employee

Accessing memberes
 Employee joe {};
    joe.id = 14;
    joe.age = 32;
    joe.wage = 60000.0;
