13.4 â€” Converting an enumeration to and from a string


Getting name of enum:

write a function that takes int and returns enum

- one way is with switch

- since c sytle strings exist for the entire program, its okay to return std::string_view on them

make this function constexprt

second way is to use an array


Unscoped enumerator input

- we can do a static_cast to get from int to enumerator

string compare, and make a function for that
