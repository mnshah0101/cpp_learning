14.1 â€” Introduction to object-oriented programming


Procedural programming:

create procedures that do something (functions)

they implement our program logic, we pass data objects to these functions
functions and are are seperate entities, the programmer is responsible for combining the produce desired results


Everything is an object, 
1) some number of associated properties and some behavoris

OOP:
- contains both properties and well defined behaviors
- objects are eaier to modularize, makes our programs easier to write and understand

OOP brings other benefits:
- making code modular and non redundant makes maintance and enhacning code easier

Term object:
- the term object is overloaded a bit, in traditional programming object is a piece of memory that stores values
