14.4 â€” Const class objects and const member functions

All const vars must be init at time of creation

class type objectes (struct, classes, unions) can be made const

they  must be init at creation

they cant be modified after creation

Modifying the data members of const objects is disallowed

Const objects may not call non-const member functions

Const member functions


const member function gaurantees it doesnt modify the object

A const member function that attempts to change a data member or call a non-const member function will cause a compiler error to occur. 


Const member functions may be called on non-const objects
this doesnt change the object, so doesnt do anything bad

Const objects via pass by const references

, a more common way to get a const object is by passing an object to a function by const reference.

- const acceptn lvalue and rvalue


const object cant call non const function


Member function const and non-const overloading

we can overload for const and non-const version of same function, this is part of functions signature
