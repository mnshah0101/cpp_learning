14.6 â€” Access functions


Access functions are trivial members functions to interact with private member variables
Come in getters and setters
(mutators and accessors)

getters should return by value (read only data)

If your class has no invaraints and requires a lot of access functions, consider a struct
- prefer implementing behvaoirs instead of actions/seetters
- prefer acecess function only when reasonable
