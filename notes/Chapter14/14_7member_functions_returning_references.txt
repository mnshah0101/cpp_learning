14.7 — Member functions returning references to data members

can return data members by lvalue const reference
usually safe since live for same lifespan

The return type of a member function returning a reference to a data member should match the data member’s type

What if we have a function that returns by value, returns a class and we use a reference to a data member, this is unsafe

using member functions that return by reference safely
it is convention to return by const reference not value
How tod o safely:
- prefer to use return value imediately instead of reference
- if you need to persist, use the returned reference as the init for a non reference vairbale, which will make a copy of the member

Do not return non-const references to private data members- subvert access control system

Const member functions can’t return non-const references to data members
