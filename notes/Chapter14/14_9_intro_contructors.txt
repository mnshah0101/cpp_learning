14.9 â€” Introduction to constructors


As soon as we make any members variables rpivate, class is no longer aggregate, and we cant use aggregate Introduction

Reasons:
 - aggregate requires knowledge about implementation of class
 - invariant would be relied on user


 Constructor:
 - a special member function that is called after non aggregate is created

 - if a matching constructor found, memory for the object is allocated, and the constructor is called
 - if non then compiler error

 constructors dont create object, compilation sets this up right before the initializer



Perform two functions:
- init of any member variables via member init list
- performs other set up functions

Naming constructirs:
- no return type not even void
- same name as class

constructors should not be cost
